# oop-practice
This is a basic project that I created in my Python class, it is meant to show use of OOP principles Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism.

All classes are in the file named classmodule.

It contains 3 classes (Person, Student and Graduate). Student inherits Person and Graduate inherits Student. The classes use some basic validation using Getters and Setters, enforcing encapsulation. 
The Graduate class makes use of polymorphsim by method overriding. 

In the second file I instantiate a few Graduate objects and use the different methods available to them.
